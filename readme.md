The Medical ChatBot, your virtual health assistant! This advanced AI-powered chatbot is designed to provide personalized medical advice, answer health-related queries, and assist users in managing their well-being effectively.

## Project Overview

The Medical ChatBot leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to understand user inputs, simulate doctor-patient interactions, and deliver accurate medical recommendations. It is built on the Rasa Open Source SDK, making it a powerful tool for healthcare assistance and patient engagement.

### Key Features:
- Seamless integration of NLP models for understanding user queries and intents.
- Implementation of custom actions for dynamic responses and backend computations.
- Deployment-ready setup for running the chatbot in various environments.

## Setup and Installation

To run the Medical ChatBot locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Create a virtual environment with Python 3.8: `python3.8 -m venv ./venv` and activate it: `source ./venv/bin/activate`.
4. Install Rasa framework: `pip install rasa`.
5. Train the Rasa model: `rasa train`.
6. Start the actions server: `rasa run actions`.
